# Around the U.S.
> web_project_4

"Around the U.S." (web_project_4) is my project at Practicum by Yandex. I've done it during the "Basic JavaScript and Working with the Browser" course. 
In this course, I learn about the different data types and how to use them with statements, loops, and functions. Then, I put theory into practice to create a fully-functioning interactive website.

## Technologies and Techniques

While developing web_project_4 I used the folowing technologies and techniques:
* JavaScript ES6
* Figma
* HTML5, CSS3, markdown
* BEM
* Visual Studio Code, Git 
* Responsive web design, Semantic markup
